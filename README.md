Clean Telco dataset using Pig &amp; perform analysis using Hive

1.To store cleaned dataset into hive, create a table telco in database telco_upx.
   create database telco_upx;
   use telco_upx;

create table telco(customerID String,gender String,SeniorCitizen Int,Partner String,Dependents String,tenure Int,PhoneService String,MultipleLines String,InternetService String,OnlineSecurity String,OnlineBackup String,DeviceProtection String,TechSupport String,StreamingTV String,StreamingMovies String,Contract String,PaperlessBilling String,PaymentMethod String,MonthlyCharges Float,TotalCharges Float,Churn String) row format delimited fields terminated by ',' tblproperties ("skip.header.line.count"="1"); 

2. pig -useHCatalog

junk_telco = LOAD 'telco_churn_esc.csv' USING org.apache.pig.piggybank.storage.CSVExcelStorage(',', 'NO_MULTILINE', 'NOCHANGE', 'SKIP_INPUT_HEADER'); 

2. Removing junk characters from the dataset 
cleaned_telco = FOREACH junk_telco GENERATE REPLACE($0,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($1,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($2,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($3,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($4,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($5,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($6,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($7,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($8,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($9,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($10,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($11,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($12,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($13,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($14,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($15,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($16,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($17,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($18,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($19,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)',''),REPLACE($20,'([^a-zA-Z0-9-.\\s]+)','');

3. Allocation of structure & datatypes before saving it to hive 
cleaned_telco1 = foreach cleaned_telco generate $0 as customerid,$1 as gender,(int)$2 as seniorcitizen,$3 as partner,$4 as dependents,(int)$5 as tenure,$6 as phoneservice,$7 as multiplelines,$8 as internetservice, $9 as onlinesecurity,$10 as onlinebackup, $11 as deviceprotection, $12 as techsupport, $13 as streamingtv, $14 as streamingmovies, $15 as contract, $16 as paperlessbilling, $17 as paymentmethod, (float)$18 as monthlycharges, (float)$19 as totalcharges, $20 as churn;

4. Storing clean data in hive
STORE cleaned_telco1 INTO 'telco_upx.telco' USING org.apache.hive.hcatalog.pig.HCatStorer();

5. Perform below analysis in Hue so as to visualize the results 

i)  How tenure of customers is effecting churn rate
select count(churn),tenure from telco_upx.telco where churn == 'Yes' group by tenure;

ii)  Analyze how online security provided by this company is effecting its churn rate 
select count(churn),onlinesecurity from telco_upx.telco where churn == 'Yes' group by onlinesecurity;

iii) Analyze the effect of senior citizens on churn rate 
select count(churn),seniorcitizen from telco_upx.telco where churn == 'Yes' group by seniorcitizen;

iv) Which gender is more likely to effect churn rate
select count(churn),gender from telco_upx.telco where churn == 'Yes' group by gender;

v) How many customers cancelled services offered by this company in the last month
select count(churn),churn from telco_upx.telco group by churn;

vi) Company waives off 10% for 1 year tenure customers, 20% for 2 year tenure customers and so onâ€¦ 60% for 6 year tenure customers. Calculate the new rates to be paid by these customers.
select round(tenure/12) as year,monthlycharges,
case when round(tenure/12) = 1 then 0.9*monthlycharges
	 when round(tenure/12) = 2 then 0.8*monthlycharges
	 when round(tenure/12) = 3 then 0.7*monthlycharges
	 when round(tenure/12) = 4 then 0.6*monthlycharges
	 when round(tenure/12) = 5 then 0.5*monthlycharges
	 when round(tenure/12) >= 6 then 0.4*monthlycharges
	 else monthlycharges end as amount_to_be_paid 
from telco_upx.telco;

vii) Statistics of number of customers according to their tenure 
select round(tenure/12) as year,count(round(tenure/12)) from telco_upx.telco group by round(tenure/12);

viii) Analyse how many customers are into paperless billing 
select paperlessbilling,count(paperlessbilling) from telco_upx.telco group by paperlessbilling;

xi)   Analyze the type of internet service most preferred by senior citizens 
select COUNT(internetservice),internetservice from telco_upx.telco where seniorcitizen = 1 group by internetservice;

x.a) which gender is more likely to watch movies,tv
x.b) Which gender is more likely to watch tv 
select gender,count(streamingtv) from telco_upx.telco group by gender;
select gender,count(streamingmovies) from telco_upx.telco group by gender;
//select gender,count(streamingtv),count(streamingmovies) from telco_upx.telco group by gender

xi) Analyze the preferred payment method of customers 
select count(paymentmethod),paymentmethod from telco_upx.telco group by paymentmethod;

xii) Analyze the most preferred payment method gender-wise 
select gender,count(paymentmethod) from telco_upx.telco group by gender;

xiii) Analyze the number of customers who are likely to make use of technical support provided by company 
select count(techsupport) from telco where techsupport == 'Yes';
